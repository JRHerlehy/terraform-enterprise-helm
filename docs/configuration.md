# Terraform Enterprise Application Configuration Options

## Custom Agent Image

Terraform Enterprise pulls the publicly available [hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent) image when kubernetes jobs are scheduled to execute plans and applies. If a custom tfc-agent image is required or the tfc-agent image should be pulled from a private container registry you can set the following environment variables:

* `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_IMAGE` : The tfc-agent path. This can include a private registry source. eg. `privateregistry.azurecr.io/tfc-agent:latest`
* `TFE_RUN_PIPELINE_KUBERNETES_IMAGE_PULL_SECRET_NAME` : The name of an ImagePullSecret in the `[namespace]-agents` namespace to use when pulling the custom source tfc-agent image.

If an ImagePullSecret is required to access a private repository you must create the secret within the `[namespace]-agents` namespace after this helm chart has installed, but before attempting a plan or apply. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for instructions for creating ImagePullSecrets.
